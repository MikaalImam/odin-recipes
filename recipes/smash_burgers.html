    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Smash burgers are a popular style of hamburger made by pressing a ball of ground beef onto a hot griddle or skillet, creating a thin, crispy-edged patty with a juicy interior. This smashing technique maximizes surface area, enhancing the Maillard reaction for a rich, caramelized crust. Typically served on a soft bun with classic toppings like cheese, pickles, onions, and special sauce, smash burgers are known for their simple yet bold flavor and satisfying texture.</p>
